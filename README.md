# infrastructure

OpenTofu, Packer and Ansible for the 0xc0-labs node: its SDN zones, its
firewall, the VMs on it, and the RKE2 cluster they run.

- **How it fits together:** [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
- **The network:** decided in [`environments/prod/terraform.tfvars`](environments/prod/terraform.tfvars), explained in [`docs/zones.md`](docs/zones.md)
- **Why it is this way:** [`workspace/docs/design.md`](https://github.com/0xc0-labs/workspace/blob/main/docs/design.md)

```
environments/prod/      the root for the node — only calls modules
modules/<name>/         the resources
packer/<template>/      bakes the templates every VM clones
scripts/tofu             runs tofu on an environment, secrets from Vault in env
scripts/ansible          runs ansible-playbook, tunnel tokens and secrets in env
scripts/vault-env        sourced by the others: each secret from Vault, unless set
scripts/packer           validates or builds a template locally
scripts/delete-template  deletes a template by name before it is rebuilt
scripts/rolling-reboot   restarts VMs one at a time, waiting for each
ansible/                 what runs inside the VMs: inventory, playbooks, roles
.github/workflows/       plan, apply, ansible, packer and issue-check pipelines
docs/                    architecture and the zone matrix
```

## Running it

Tools come from `mise.toml`. Secrets come from Vault, over WARP, and never
touch disk:

```
vault login -no-print
scripts/tofu prod init
scripts/tofu prod plan
```

Every change goes through a PR linked to an issue. `plan` comments the plan on
the PR; `apply` runs after merge and waits for the operator's approval. The
conventions are the org's, in
[`0xc0-labs/.github`](https://github.com/0xc0-labs/.github#conventions).

The Traefik, RustFS and PBS running on the node are **not** managed here.
